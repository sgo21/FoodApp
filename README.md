# Comp 426 Final Project- Foodie

This is our full repository for our Comp 426 final project.
The project is live at: https://foodapp-35256.web.app/

## Description

Foodie is a revolutionary food-searching application. Foodie enables its users to easily search for food items, recipes, and ingredients. The user is also able to specify a specific diet plan option before searching. Once the ingredient/food item has been searched, foodie will provide various options for foods that match the search criteria. Foodie pulls these foods from a back-end API called Edamam, which stores a large database of food items and its corresponding descriptions. Once the user has found a recipe of his/her liking, the user is able to 'favorite' this item and save it to a personal recipe book. The recipe book can be found by navigating to the user's Profile page. Each food item also displays a calorie counter and diet label in order to track overall nutrition. Additionally, the recipes include ingredients and links to external recipe websites to provide a quick way to make the item. Each user is required to create a personal profile before using the Foodie application. The user's personal data and relevant information is saved within the Foodie Firebase database.
